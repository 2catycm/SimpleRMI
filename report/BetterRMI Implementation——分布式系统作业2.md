> Java RMI, so wonderful, Makes your code more beautiful. It lets your program be distributed, Communicating between JVMs, undisputed(不可争辩的).
>
> Java RMI, so magical, Makes your program more practical. It lets your objects be remotely invoked, Transferring between hosts, no problem evoked.
>
> Java RMI, so charming, Makes your program more alarming. It lets your code be more concise, Interacting between processes, no compromise.

[TOC]

## Part 1 Introduction

> In this part, I will briefly **restate the problem** we are solving in this assignment, articulating the **study objectives** and some **research questions** that will be answered by the experiment and practice.  

### The goal of this project

In this assignment, we are required to use **MPI** to implement **parallel matrix multiplication**. The goal of this project should contain:

- Learn the basic usage of MPI. Configure the environment. 
- Discover the charm of MPI in the scene of parallel matrix multiplication. Survey the algorithms for parallel matrix multiplication. 
- Recognize the patterns of scalability via experiments. 

### Some issues to consider

- 

## Part 2 Methodology

> In this part, we learn and explore the methods to solve problems above by doing a literature review on the internet together. We summarize the key points that are useful for our experiments. 

### Interface of RMI

#### Will Server also create a stub besides a skeleton?



#### The life cycle of Remote Object: Will registry still exist when server process had finished?



#### Will JVM transport the class definition? What happens when interface are different?



#### Will JVM transport the class definition? What happens when arguments are not Serializable



#### Difference of bind and rebind



### Problem of RMI





## Part 3 Experiment 

### Experiment Infrastructure: The Junit Test Framework

### 

#### Experiment principle



#### Experiment result and conclusion





## Part 4 Conclusion

In this project, I have learnt a lot.
